# 质量属性



## Specifying Qulity Attributes

准确的定义质量属性对在架构层面上进行评估是十分有必要的。

质量属性场景是用来定义目标质量属性的重要方法。

场景是有着确定结构的简单句子，两类主要的场景是：

1.  通用场景是系统独立的场景，目的是去引导整个质量属性需求
2. 具体场景是系统相关的场景，目的是去构建在质量属性在具体应用上的定义。 这是通用场景的一种扩展。



#### General Scenarios

* 通用场景提供了一个去产生大量的通用，系统独立的质量属性场景的框架。
* 每个质量属性都潜在的但不是必然和我们处理的系统相关。
* 为了让通用场景对与具体的系统产生作用，我们必须把针对系统进行定制。

##### 组成元素

* Stimulus:  当到达系统时一个需要被考虑到的条件。
* Source of Stimulus:  一个产生刺激的实体。
* Response:  当刺激到达后产生的行动
* Response Meassure:   对刺激的回应必须在某种程度上可以进行测量，这样对应的需求才可以被检验。
* 环境， 当刺激发生时系统处于的条件。 
* Artifat: 整个系统或者需求对应的系统的一部分。

#### Tactics

TODO: 



#### 质量设计决策

一共有7种类型的决策：

1. 职责的分配
2. coordination model
3. Data model
4. management of resources
5. Mapping among architecture elements
6. Binding time decisions
7. Choice of technology

##### Environment 

###### general 

Normal operation,startup,shutdown,repair mode,degraded operation, overloaded operation 

###### concrete

Normal operation



##### Response 

###### general

Prevent the fault from becoming a failure 

Detect the fault: 

- Log the fault 
- Notify appropriate entities (people or systems) 

Recover from the fault: 

- Disable source of events causing the fault 
- Be temporarily unavailable while repair is being effected 
- Fix or mask the fault/failure or contain the damage it causes 
- Operate in a degraded mode while repair is being effected 



###### concrete

Inform operator continue to operate



#####Response Measure 

###### general

Time or time interval when the system must be available Availability percentage (e.g., 99.999%)
 Time to detect the fault
 Time to repair the fault 

Time or time interval in which system can be in degraded mode Proportion (e.g., 99%) or rate (e.g., up to 100 per second) of a certain class of faults that the system prevents, or handles without failing

##### Stimulus 

###### general 

A request to exchange information among system(s).

###### concrete

Current Location Sent



##### Artifact 

###### general

##### Environment 

###### general 

System(s) wishing to interoperate are discovered at runtime or known prior to runtime.

###### concrete

Systems known prior to run-time



##### Response 

###### general

One or more of the following: 

- The request is (appropriately) rejected and appropriate 

  entities (people or systems) are notified. 

- The request is (appropriately) accepted and information is 

  exchanged successfully. 

- The request is logged by one or more of the involved 

  systems.

###### concrete

1. * Percentage of information exchanges correctly processed 

2. * Percentage of information exchanges correctly rejected 

###### concrete

#### 安全性

##### Source 

###### general 

Human or another system which may have been previously identified (either correctly or incorrectly) or may be currently unknown. A human attacker may be from outside the organization or from inside the organization.

###### concrete

Disgruntled Employee from Remote Location 



##### Stimulus 

###### general 

Unauthorized attempt is made to display data, change or delete data, access system services, change the system’s behavior, or reduce availability.

###### concrete

Attempts to Modify Pay Rate



##### Artifact 

###### general

System services, data within the system, a component or resources of the system, data produced or consumed by the system

###### concrete

Data within the System



##### Environment 

###### general 

The system is either online or offline; either connected to or disconnected from a network; either behind a firewall or open to a network; fully operational, partially operational, or not operational.

###### concrete

##### Response 

###### general

- Transactions are carried out in a fashion such that 

  - Data or services are protected from unauthorized access. 

  - Data or services are not being manipulated without authorization. 

  - Parties to a transaction are identified with assurance. 

  - The parties to the transaction cannot repudiate their 

    involvements. 

  - The data, resources, and system services will be available for 

    legitimate use.
     The system tracks activities within it by 

  - Recording access or modification 

  - Recording attempts to access data, resources, or services 

  - Notifying appropriate entities (people or systems) when an 

    apparent attack is occurring

     component or data value is compromised 

   - How much time passed before an attack was detected 

   - How many attacks were resisted 

   - How long does it take to recover from a successful attack 

   - How much data is vulnerable to a particular attack
