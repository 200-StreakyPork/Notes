# 软件产品线

## 一. 产品线基本



### 1. 概述和概念

#### 1. 什么是软件产品线

* Lots of different (but related) Products

* Assembled from reused Core Assets

**Products = Custom Assets + Core Assets**

A software product line is a set of software intensive systems **sharing a common, managed set of features** that satisfy the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are **developed from a common set of core assets** in a prescribed way.



##### Core Assets
– Reused by many (or all) products in the SPL
– Embody domain knowledge/expertise
– Provide variation points for variable features
– Implements requirements within the SPL scope



##### Custom Assets
– Specific to a particular product
– Meet customer-specific requirements
– Can also implement requirements out of the SPL scope
– Integrate core assets required for the product
– Instantiate variation points provided by core assets

#### 2. 产品线优点

Economies of Scale
– Spread core asset costs over more products
– Especially Design, Coding, Unit Test costs



Simplicity – it’s easier to:
– See what assets are “core” for the business
– See how different products differ
– Upgrade customised products with new “core”



Turn Project Work into Product Features
– Separate custom assets out from a product
– Re-use them as “core” assets in other products



Improve Product Quality
– Core asset bug fixes are done once
– Core asset bug fixes are more easily shared
– Products have different patterns of use
• Exposes different bugs – improves overall quality



• Improve Time-to-Market
– For a new product, don’t need to re-develop the core
– Approach the dream of “Lego” components & products



例如还可以从代码行的角度去分析（但是这个例子把传统的看做成了完全不动，还是有一点不是很理解）

#### 3. 重用 和 变更

Code reuse is easy!
– (If it already does exactly what you want!)
– To reuse code, a developer just needs to:

1. find it
2. understand it
3. invoke it



Code that’s “almost what you want”…
– …is normally completely useless
– Often can only reuse it by “cut and paste”
• a.k.a. “clone and own”
• And only if you have the source code too



• Identify and Support “Variation Points”
– Lists all allowed variation
– Architectural interfaces for variation
– Specifies mechanisms to instantiate variation points
– (See variation mechanisms later)

Reuse Mechanisms

Variation Mechanisms
– Level of variation
– Binding time





设计点和变化维度

#### 1. FORMS OF VARIATION

–  Include or omit elements
–  Variable number of each element
–  Interface Satisfaction
• Different implementations satisfying a uniform interface
• Sub-typing (and OO inheritance)
• Vary behaviour without varying integration structure
– Parameterisation
• Let clients choose from a pre-specified range of functionality
– “Hook” interfaces
• Let client software supply the variant functionality
– Reflection
• Make elements discover and react to their (variable) context

#### 2. SOFTWARE ENTITY VARIED

Architecture level – High-level abstract structures
– e.g. frameworks, deployment configurations, schemas, etc
• Design level – Lower-level abstract structures
– e.g. classes, interfaces, methods, etc
• File level – low-level concrete source structures
– e.g. directory hierarchies, files, lines of source code, etc

#### 3. BINDING TIME

Coding-time – when you create a coding workspace
• Compile-time – when you build object code
• Link-time – when you create your application
• Initialization-time – when your application starts
• Run-time – while your application is running
