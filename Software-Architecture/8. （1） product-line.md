# 软件产品线

## 一. 产品线基本



### 1. 概述和概念

#### 1. 什么是软件产品线

* Lots of different (but related) Products

* Assembled from reused Core Assets

**Products = Custom Assets + Core Assets**

A software product line is a set of software intensive systems **sharing a common, managed set of features** that satisfy the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are **developed from a common set of core assets** in a prescribed way.



##### Core Assets
– Reused by many (or all) products in the SPL
– Embody domain knowledge/expertise
– Provide variation points for variable features
– Implements requirements within the SPL scope



##### Custom Assets
– Specific to a particular product
– Meet customer-specific requirements
– Can also implement requirements out of the SPL scope
– Integrate core assets required for the product
– Instantiate variation points provided by core assets

#### 2. 产品线优点

Economies of Scale
– Spread core asset costs over more products
– Especially Design, Coding, Unit Test costs



Simplicity – it’s easier to:
– See what assets are “core” for the business
– See how different products differ
– Upgrade customised products with new “core”



Turn Project Work into Product Features
– Separate custom assets out from a product
– Re-use them as “core” assets in other products



Improve Product Quality
– Core asset bug fixes are done once
– Core asset bug fixes are more easily shared
– Products have different patterns of use
• Exposes different bugs – improves overall quality



• Improve Time-to-Market
– For a new product, don’t need to re-develop the core
– Approach the dream of “Lego” components & products



例如还可以从代码行的角度去分析（但是这个例子把传统的看做成了完全不动，还是有一点不是很理解）

#### 3. 重用 和 变更

Code reuse is easy!
– (If it already does exactly what you want!)
– To reuse code, a developer just needs to:

1. find it
2. understand it
3. invoke it



Code that’s “almost what you want”…
– …is normally completely useless
– Often can only reuse it by “cut and paste”
• a.k.a. “clone and own”
• And only if you have the source code too



• Identify and Support “Variation Points”
– Lists all allowed variation
– Architectural interfaces for variation
– Specifies mechanisms to instantiate variation points
– (See variation mechanisms later)

Reuse Mechanisms

Variation Mechanisms
– Level of variation
– Binding time





设计点和变化维度

#### 1. FORMS OF VARIATION

–  Include or omit elements
–  Variable number of each element
–  Interface Satisfaction
• Different implementations satisfying a uniform interface
• Sub-typing (and OO inheritance)
• Vary behaviour without varying integration structure
– Parameterisation
• Let clients choose from a pre-specified range of functionality
– “Hook” interfaces
• Let client software supply the variant functionality
– Reflection
• Make elements discover and react to their (variable) context

#### 2. SOFTWARE ENTITY VARIED

Architecture level – High-level abstract structures
– e.g. frameworks, deployment configurations, schemas, etc
• Design level – Lower-level abstract structures
– e.g. classes, interfaces, methods, etc
• File level – low-level concrete source structures
– e.g. directory hierarchies, files, lines of source code, etc

#### 3. BINDING TIME

Coding-time – when you create a coding workspace
• Compile-time – when you build object code
• Link-time – when you create your application
• Initialization-time – when your application starts
• Run-time – while your application is running

1. What distinguishes an architecture for a software product line from an architecture for a single product?



软件产品线是指具有⼀组可管理理的公共特性的软件密集性系统的合集，这些系统满足特定的 市场需求或任务需求，并且按预定义的⽅方式从⼀一个公共的核⼼心资产集开发得到。 



首先，与单个产品架构相⽐比，产品线中的产品分为custom assets 和 core assets 两部分 

所以它们的主要不同在于关注点转移:   从单独的产品到产品线的项目暗示了一个策略: 从特定的项目开发到特定业务领域产品的愿景产品线关注产品的特征，⽽单个产品架构更关注项目本身。



此外，产品线具有可重用和可变性两大特征。
产品线中的重⽤与单个产品架构中代码的重用相比，还包括了需求、业务等，几乎已经是开发者想要的了，⽽不用像单个产品架构中那样复制之后再修改。

产品线架构还拥有可变性的特点，在如单个产品架构定义正常功能之外，还定义了可改变的功能，可以识别并支持 variation points。 

总的来说，软件生产线架构与单个产品架构相比，可以减少成本、快速上市、减少风险、提高质量，更容易适应市场。
