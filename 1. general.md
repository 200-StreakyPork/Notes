## 软件体系结构基本概念



### 1. 软件体系结构的定义



The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them.    （ SEI ）

**KeyWord:  structure,  element, property, relation**

The fundamental organization of a system, emboied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and principles governing its design and evolution. （ IEEE ）

**KeyWord:  organzation,  compnents, relationship, principle**



**上面一般取第一个就可以**



### 2. 软件架构师的工作 ？ 

1. Liaison 协调各方，沟通交流
2. Software Engineering  软件工程的基本技能
3. Technology Knowledge。软件开发技术的基本知识
4. Risk Management。 风险管理能力



### 3. 软件架构的来源 ?

NFRs, ASRs, Quality Requirements, Stakeholders, Organisations, Technical Environments

1. NFRs, 非功能需求，一般包括约束和质量属性
2. Architecture Significant Requirement  架构攸关需求。 
3. Quality Requirements. 在功能需求的基础上需要满足的特征
4. Stakeholders  系统的利益相关者
5. Organisations  开发组织
6. Techinal Environments 技术环境

不不仅仅局限于需求，可能是商业和技术决定的集合

### 4.  架构视图

Modern systems are frequently **too complex to grasp all at once**.  Instead, we **restrict our attention** at any one moment to one (or a small number) of the software system’s structures. To communicate meaningfully about an architecture, we must make clear which structure or structures we are
discussing at the moment—which view we are taking of the architecture.

The views are used to describe the system from the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers, system engineer, and project managers.

#### 4.1  Logical view

The logical view is concerned with the functionality that the system provides to end-users.

UML diagrams used to represent the logical view include  class diagrams  and  state diagrams。 

**describes architecturally significant elements of the architecture and the relationships between them.**  

#### 4.2  Process view

The process view deals with the dynamic aspects of the system, explains the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system. The process view addresses concurrency, distribution, integrators, performance, and scalability, etc.

 UML diagrams to represent process view include the  activity diagram.

**Concurrency and communications elements of an architecture**

#### 4.3 Physical view

The physical view depicts the system from a system engineer's point of view. It is concerned with the topology of software components on the physical layer as well as the physical connections between these components. This view is also known as the deployment view. 

UML diagrams used to represent the physical view include the  deployment diagram.

**how the major processes and components are mapped on to the applications hardware**

#### 4.4 Development view

The development view illustrates a system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management. This view is also known as the implementation view. It uses the UML Component diagram  to describe system components. 

UML Diagrams used to represent the development view include the  Package diagram.

**captures the internal orgnazition of software components **

#### 4.5 Architecture use cases

The description of an architecture is illustrated using a small set of  use cases , or scenarios, which become a fifth view. The scenarios describe sequences of interactions between objects and between processes. They are used to identify architectural elements and to illustrate and validate the architecture design. They also serve as a starting point for tests of an architecture prototype.  This view is also known as the  use case view.

**capture the requirements for architecture, related to more than one particular view**



加粗部分是老师ppt上的描述，其他是维基百科上的描述

以及为什么 类图是 end-user 视角， 包图就是程序员视角？？？
